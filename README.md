## 💡 What Makes Me Different

Most DevOps engineers come from development backgrounds. I come from **9 years of fixing production incidents at 3 AM.**

I've seen what breaks systems. Now I build systems that **fix themselves**.

---

## 🎯 What I've Built

### 🔄 Self-Healing Infrastructure That Actually Works
**Problem Solved:** Manual incident response taking 15+ minutes, causing revenue loss  
**Solution Built:** Automated monitoring → detection → recovery pipeline  
**Tech:** Prometheus, Alertmanager, Flask (Python), Ansible, AWS EC2  
**Impact:** Recovery time reduced from **15 min → <2 min** (88% faster)

### 🚀 Zero-Touch CI/CD Pipeline
**Problem Solved:** Manual deployments prone to human error, slow release cycles  
**Solution Built:** Fully automated build → test → containerize → deploy workflow  
**Tech:** GitHub Actions, Docker, DockerHub, Node.js (Express)  
**Impact:** Deployment time reduced **80%**, zero deployment errors

---

### ☁️ Production-Grade AWS Static Hosting
**Problem Solved:** Expensive hosting with manual deployment overhead  
**Solution Built:** S3 + CloudFront + automated CI/CD pipeline  
**Tech:** AWS (S3, CloudFront, Route53), GitHub Actions, Terraform  
**Impact:** 90% cost reduction vs traditional hosting, instant deployments
