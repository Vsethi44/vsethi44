## 🎯 My Transition Story

After 9 years solving technical problems for Dell and Capgemini clients, I realized something:

**The best support is the support that never needs to happen.**

So I transitioned from **fixing issues manually** to **building systems that fix themselves.**

---

## 🛠️ What I've Built

### 🔄 Self-Healing Infrastructure
An automated system that monitors services and recovers from failures without human intervention

**Tech Stack:** Prometheus, Alertmanager, Flask (Python), Ansible, AWS EC2  
**Result:** Automated recovery reduces downtime from manual response times

**[→ View Project](https://github.com/Vsethi44/Self-Healing-Infrastructure-with-Prometheus-Alertmanager-Ansible)** | Screenshots + Demo Available

---

### 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline with Docker
Fully automated build, test, and deployment workflow for Node.js applications

**Tech Stack:** GitHub Actions, Docker, DockerHub, Node.js (Express)  
**Result:** Zero-touch deployments from code commit to production

**[→ View Project](https://github.com/Vsethi44/End-to-End-CI-CD-for-Node.js-Application-using-Docker-GitHub-Actions)** | Live Demo Available

---

### ☁️ AWS Static Website Hosting
Production-ready static site deployment with automated CI/CD and CDN

**Tech Stack:** AWS S3, CloudFront, GitHub Actions  
**Result:** Automated deployments with global content delivery

## 💡 My Approach

**I learned cloud/DevOps because I was tired of being called at 3 AM to restart services manually.**

Now I build systems where:
- Monitoring catches issues before users notice
- Automation handles routine recovery
- Documentation means anyone can understand what's happening
- CI/CD means deployments aren't scary

**From my support background, I know:** Users don't care about your tech stack. They care if it works when they need it.
