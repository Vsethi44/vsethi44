## 🚀 Why Cloud & DevOps
After 9 years in IT support, I learned one thing clearly:

**The best support is the support that never needs to happen.**

So I moved from manually fixing issues to building **automated, self-healing systems** that reduce incidents instead of reacting to them.

---

## 🛠️ Projects (Production-focused)

### 🔄 Self-Healing Infrastructure
Auto-detects failures and recovers services without human intervention.  
**Tech:** Prometheus, Alertmanager, Flask (Python), Ansible, AWS EC2  
**Impact:** Auto-recovery in **< 60 seconds**, no manual restarts

---

### 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline with Docker
End-to-end automated build, test & deployment for Node.js applications.  
**Tech:** GitHub Actions, Docker, DockerHub, Node.js  
**Impact:** Zero-touch deployments from commit to production  
👉 [View Project](https://github.com/Vsethi44/End-to-End-CI-CD-for-Node.js-Application-using-Docker-GitHub-Actions)

---

### ☁️ AWS Static Website (CI/CD + CDN)
Production-ready static site with automated deployments and global delivery.  
**Tech:** S3, CloudFront, GitHub Actions

## 💡 Philosophy
Users don’t care about your tech stack.  
They care if the system works when they need it.

**Support taught me how systems break. DevOps taught me how to prevent it.**
